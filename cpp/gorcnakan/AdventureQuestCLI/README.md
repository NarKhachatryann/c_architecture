## Game Overview

Adventure Quest is designed to give players a modular and dynamic RPG experience, leveraging advanced C++ programming concepts such as:
- **Abstract Classes**: Base class `Character` manages shared attributes for all game entities.
- **Interfaces**: Define behaviors like `Interactable` for NPCs and `Combatable` for battle-ready characters.
- **Dynamic Polymorphism**: Seamlessly handles character behaviors and interactions during runtime.
- **RTTI**: Run-Time Type Identification provides custom behaviors based on the character's type (e.g., a Mageâ€™s spell damage or NPC-specific dialogue).
